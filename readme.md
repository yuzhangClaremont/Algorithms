# Greedy algorithm
fast, easy, but only locally optimal

have as many intervel as pussible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWlXudP7Unk
1. pick shortest
2. cross off all the overlaps
3. pick the next shortest

__not correct__

or
1. pick the earlist intervels
__not work__

or
1. pick intervals finish earlest
2. cross off overlaps
3. pick the next finish earlest
__this works__

or
1. pick the one starts latest
2. corss overlapps
3. recurse to next starts latest



path problem: for every decision tree, choose branch with least cost

2-d array peak, point is a peak iff it's >= than all points in the east, west, north,and south
find a peak in a 2-d array
